```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_report(data):
    # Generate customizable report based on user requirements
    # Example: Generate a report with average returns and risk metrics
    report = {}
    report['Average Returns'] = data.mean()
    report['Risk Metrics'] = data.std()
    
    return report

def plot_performance(data):
    # Plot the performance of the trading system
    # Example: Plot the cumulative returns over time
    cumulative_returns = (data + 1).cumprod() - 1
    plt.plot(cumulative_returns)
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
    plt.title('Performance of the Trading System')
    plt.show()
```

This is the code for the `customizable_reporting_options.py` file. It includes two functions: `generate_report` and `plot_performance`.

The `generate_report` function takes in a `data` parameter, which represents the trading data, and generates a customizable report based on user requirements. In this example, it calculates the average returns and risk metrics of the trading system.

The `plot_performance` function also takes in the `data` parameter and plots the performance of the trading system over time. In this example, it plots the cumulative returns.

Please note that this code assumes the availability of the necessary data and libraries mentioned in the prompt.

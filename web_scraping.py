```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def web_scraping(url):
    # Send a GET request to the specified URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the HTML content of the response
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        
        # Extract the desired data from the parsed HTML
        # ...
        
        # Return the extracted data
        return data
    else:
        # Handle the case when the request fails
        print("Failed to retrieve data from the specified URL.")
        return None

# Example usage
url = "https://www.example.com"
data = web_scraping(url)
if data is not None:
    print(data)
```
This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. The `web_scraping` function takes a URL as input and sends a GET request to retrieve the HTML content of the page. It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the desired data. The extracted data can be further processed or used for analysis in the automated trading system.

Note: This is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and structure of the target website.
